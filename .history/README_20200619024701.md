This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites
The project has the following dependencies
- It assumes you have a ros-melodic or kinectic environment setup. [Link](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- It assumes you have moveit and its associated rviz components installed  [Link](https://moveit.ros.org/install/)
```bash
    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-moveit 
```
- For the robots you want to simulate in the viz, make sure you have the moveit support packages installed [Link](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot)
```bash
    sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-universal-robot
```
### Note: 
universal_robot doesn't have a melodic release. You can use the kinetic-devel branch of their github repo and build it from source in your workspace
```
cd <<YOUR ROS_WORKSPACE>>/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot.git
catkin build
```
- rosbridge_server installed
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosbridge-suite 
```
- Working knowledge of roslaunch/moveit


## Steps to use this codebase
1. Launch a moveit + rviz environment
- This loads the robot into robot_description parameter
- It initializes an empty planning scene. 
- Also initializes  robot joint state nodes
- We additionally launch a rosbridge_server

```
#For ABB irb1200_5_90
roslaunch abb_irb1200_5_90_moveit_config demo.launch 
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch 

```
or
```
#For UR3
roslaunch ur3_moveit_config demo.launch
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch 
```

2. Copy the support/description packages to the public folder of this webapp.
support>description package for a robot is the package with the urdf & meshes. 
We have included the ur description  and an abb description for quicker testing. 
This is needed for the webapp to respove and reference the correct files when loading meshes

3. Clone the ui repo & Install the node dependencies
```
git clone https://github.com/wiresurfer/rocketfarm-starter.git
cd rocketfarm-starter
npm install
npm run start
```
4. launch the browser. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5. Bonus:
  If you use rviz to plan an execute to a new pose, you should be able to see the webui Robot move too. 

  
### Implementation Note: 
1. We have the websocket port hardcoded to localhost:9090.  adjust this if you have changed your rosbridge launch config.  App.js
2. As this is a refactor from our internal application, we haven't yet implemented graceful disconnection & reconnection logic. 
3. In production the description package, is hosted by a separate backend service. Its not shipped as part of the frontend application. We have hosted the meshes out of the public folder of the react app for an easy dev environment for rocketfarm




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
